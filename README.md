# notion-practice
Using this to experiment with notion Tasks' auto update, if a task is linked to a PR.
Use it for any further practice invloving github integration in notion Projects and Tasks

> An example is when you have an app with repo at github, and you want to make changes/update a feature. You may make a new project called "Update abc feature" and assign in it a new task like "Changed colors & style of abc feature to match new theme" and open a PR at gh. To this task in notion, you can link the PR by "[notion ID] PR name" hence once the PR is approved, the task in notion autoupdates to "Done"
